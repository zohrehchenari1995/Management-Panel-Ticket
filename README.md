# 🎟️ Cinema Ticket Booking

This project is part of my portfolio and highlights my front-end development skills.

🎯 Goal

The goal of the Cinema Ticket Booking project is to demonstrate practical front-end development skills by building a clean, responsive, and interactive user interface using only HTML and CSS.

This project focuses specifically on:

Designing structured layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox

Building a responsive seat selection interface

Creating organized movie listing sections

Implementing scalable and maintainable CSS architecture

Developing a responsive experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

Applying modern UI design principles without JavaScript frameworks

### 🌍 Real-World Application

This project simulates a real-world cinema ticket booking interface where users can browse available movies, view showtimes, and select their preferred seats through a structured seating layout.

In a real production environment, this interface could be integrated with:

User authentication and account systems

Real-time seat availability management

Online payment gateways

Booking confirmation and ticket generation systems

Movie database APIs

Admin dashboards for cinema management

Dynamic showtime scheduling systems

It demonstrates how front-end layout systems can be applied to entertainment platforms, ticket reservation systems, and online booking services.
